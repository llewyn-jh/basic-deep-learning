# Recurrent neural network

Text data is classified by RNN.

## Goal

1. Study sequential data and RNN.
2. Build a RNN and classify text data.
3. Build a RNN using by Tensorflow.
4. Build a LSTM RNN and classify text data.

## Description

 - recurrent_neural_network.py: it's a python class object. This consists of variables initializer, forward, backward, network training, loss calculater, data batch, accuracy calculater methods.
 - recurrent_neural_network_train.py: this trains a RNN in recurrent_neural_network.py on Tensorflow IMDB data.
 - recurrent_neural_network_train.ipynb: there is all of recurrent_neural_network_train.py and recurrent_neural_network.py. It's for unit test and visualization of a result.
